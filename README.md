> We recommend using Watchdogs from https://github.com/klantle/watchdogs/tags if you want guaranteed stability and security rather than the rapid updates from upstream. Executables are already available for each platform.

### Termux

> We highly recommend using the Termux distribution directly from GitHub instead of the Google Play Store to ensure compatibility with the latest Termux features and to enjoy the freedom offered outside the Play Store. https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases

## Usage Guide

### Basic Operations

Get help:
```bash
Usage: help | help [<command>]
```

### Compilation Commands

**Compile default gamemode:**
```bash
compile .
```

**Compile specific file:**
```bash
compile yourmode.pwn
```

**Compile with specific path:**
```bash
compile path/to/yourmode.pwn
```

### Server Management

> It operates as usual by running the samp-server or open.mp server binary according to its default name in watchdogs.toml. In the `[<args>]` section, how it works is by modifying the `gamemode0` parameter in server.cfg for SA-MP or the `main_scripts` parameter in config.json for Open.MP.

**Start server with default gamemode:**
```bash
running .
```

**Start server with specific gamemode:**
```bash
running yourmode
```

**Compile and start in one command:**
```bash
crunn
```

### Dependency Management

> Serves as an assistant for installing various files required by SA-MP/Open.MP. When installing dependencies that contain a `plugins/` folder and include files, it will install them into the `plugins/` and `/pawno-qawno/include` directories, respectively. It also handles gamemode components (root watchdogs). Watchdogs will automatically add the include names to the gamemode based on the main gamemode filename specified in the `input` key within `watchdogs.toml`. Furthermore, Watchdogs assists in installing the plugin names and their respective formats into `config.json` (from watchdogs.toml) - (for Open.MP) or `server.cfg` (from watchdogs.toml) - (for SA-MP). Note that the `components/` directory is not required for Open.MP.

> For plugin or include files located in the root directory of the dependency archive (for both Linux and Windows), their installation paths will be adjusted accordingly. Plugins found in the root folder will be placed directly into the server's root directory, rather than in specific subdirectories like `plugins/` or `components/`.

> The handling of YSI includes differs due to their structure containing multiple nested folders of include files. In this case, the entire folder containing these includes is moved directly to the target path (e.g., `pawno/include` or `qawno/include`), streamlining the process.

> Upon completion of the file transfers, all affected paths are hashed using the SHA256 algorithm in hexadecimal format via the OpenSSL/Crypto library. The resulting hash is then stored in `wd_depends.json`.

**Install dependencies from configuration:**
```bash
install
```

**Install specific repository:**
```bash
install repo/user
```

**Install specific version:**
```bash
install repo/user:v1.1
```

### Make Commands Reference

```bash
make                # Install libraries and build
make linux          # Build for Linux
make windows        # Build for Windows
make termux         # Build for Termux
make clean          # Clean build artifacts
make debug          # Build with debug mode (Linux)
make debug-termux   # Build with debug mode (Termux)
make windows-debug  # Build with debug mode (Windows)
```

### XTerm Usage

```bash
xterm -hold -e ./watchdogs          # Linux
xterm -hold -e ./watchdogs.win      # Windows  
xterm -hold -e ./watchdogs.tmux     # Termux
```

### Command Aliases

Create alias for easier access:
```bash
alias watch='./path/to/watchdogs'
```

Default (if in root directory):
```bash
alias watch='./watchdogs'
```

## Compiler Reference

> Pawncc is essentially an extension for converting .pwn files into .amx files (a converter). The primary language for SA-MP/Open.MP is [Pawn Code](https://www.compuphase.com/pawn/pawn.htm), and pawno/qawno are Pawn Editors designed to facilitate the integration of Pawncc itself. PawnCC refers to a modified version of Pawncc from pawn-lang - https://github.com/pawn-lang/compiler, which means Pawn Community Compiler (PawnCC or PCC).

> You need the -Z+ option if it exists to support specific paths with `\` on Linux and `/` on Windows for cross-platform compatibility. https://github.com/pawn-lang/compiler/wiki/Compatibility-mode

> There may be instances where the -i"path/" option does not reliably detect include files located in subdirectories within the specified path. To address this, Watchdogs implements its own detection mechanism to recursively scan and add all folders within pawno-qawno/include and gamemodes/.
> By default, Watchdogs disables the automatic `-i` flag for folders under `gamemodes/` or `pawno-qawno/include/` https://github.com/klantle/watchdogs/blob/main/utils.c#L1390 https://github.com/klantle/watchdogs/blob/main/utils.c#L1374 because the compiler can still handle includes correctly even if the flag is not explicitly set. Users can manually enable it by adding a trailing / to the target folder, allowing the compiler to automatically include all subdirectories under that path.
